# ```netwhat```
```netwhat``` is one of the three projects following [**```libft```**](https://github.com/maxdesalle/42/tree/main/libft). The purpose is to get a short but in-depth introduction to networking.

I have published all the research have I done for this project in the ```research.md``` file. If you are a 42 student working on ```netwhat```, you should already have a pretty good understanding of networking after reading the ```research.md``` file.

## What I have learned
During this project, I have had the chance to learn everything regarding the basics of networking as well as how to calculate and count in binary. I genuinely didn't know how to count in binary before and this project forced me to understand it as it's essential in order to calculate the host range, network address and broadcast address of a given IP address. Oh, and I finally know the difference between TCP and UDP, and IPv4 and IPv6.

## Warning
This repository does **not** contain the answers to the questions of the quiz. It merely contains the research I have made in order to understand what needs to be understood for this project. Aside from that, there is **no** guarantee that the content is correct, as I have written it in my own words.
