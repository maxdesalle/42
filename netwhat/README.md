# ```netwhat```
```netwhat``` is one of the three projects following [```libft```](https://github.com/maxdesalle/42/tree/main/libft). The purpose is to get a short but in-depth introduction to networking.

I have published all the research have I done for this project in the ```research.md``` file. If you are a 42 student working on ```netwhat```, you should already have a pretty good understanding of networking after reading the ```research.md``` file.

## Warning
This repository does **not** contain the answers to the questions of the quiz. It merely contains the research I have made in order to understand what needs to be understood for this project. Aside from that, there is **no** guarantee that the content is correct, as I have written it in my own words.
