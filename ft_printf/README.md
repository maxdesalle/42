# ```ft_printf```
```ft_printf``` is one of the three projects following [**```Libft```**](https://github.com/maxdesalle/42/tree/main/libft).

The project consists of re-creating from scratch the ```printf``` function in C from the ```stdio.h``` library.

## How to use it
if you want to try it out, simply clone this repository and execute the following commands:
```console
cd 42/ft_printf/
```
```console
make
```
```console
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror src/main.c libftprintf.a -I include && ./a.out
```

I have included a ```main.c``` file in the ```src``` folder where you will be able to try it out the ```ft_printf``` function. Have fun!
