# 42
This is the repository containing all the code I have written for projects at 19, a developer school based in Belgium and part of the 42 network.

## Why is your code so weird?
At 19 (and in every school part of the 42 network), we need to respect a norm wich is strictly imposed by the school. This means we can't use ```for``` loops for example and that or functions can't be longer than 25 lines.
