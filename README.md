This is the repository containing all the code I have written for projects at 19, a developer school based in Belgium and part of the 42 network.

## FAQ
### Why is your code so weird?
At 19 (and in every school part of the 42 network), we need to respect a norm wich is strictly imposed by the school. This means we can't use ```for``` loops for example and that or functions can't be longer than 25 lines.

### I have a question, how can I reach out to you?
If you are a student at 42, you can find me on slack with the following username: ```mdesalle```.

If you aren't, feel free to DM me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/maxdesalle) or send an email [here](mailto:maxdesalle@pm.me).
