# minishell

**minishell** is a minimal version of ```bash 5.1``` coded in **C** by [Maxime Desalle](https://github.com/maxdesalle), [Gregoire NÃ¨ve](https://github.com/s19gregoire) and [Milena Lazzaretti](https://github.com/m3zh).

## How to use it
To try out **minishell**, compile it first using:
```bash
make re
```
Then, open the shell as follows:
```bash
./minishell
```

It works exactly like ```bash 5.1``` (specifically on MacOS), so feel free to navigate using ```cd```, create folders with ```mkdir```, or change the environment with ```export <your variable>=<the value of your variable>```.
